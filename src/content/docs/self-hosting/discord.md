title: Self-host on Discord
description: Install, configure, reverse-proxy, back up and upgrade a self-hosted Sylo Discord bot.
---


Everything needed to run your own instance: install, configuration, a reverse
proxy, upgrades and rollback, and a troubleshooting table. For what each feature
does, see [the module docs](/modules/moderation/).

Sylo is a single Node 22 process — the Discord bot and the web dashboard in one.
No build step. All state is one SQLite file under a mounted data directory by
default — that's the right choice for nearly everyone; see
[docs/postgres.md](https://github.com/Ferdinand99/Sylo/blob/main/docs/postgres.md) if you're running at hosted scale and want
the optional Postgres backend instead.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ferdinand99/Sylo.git
cd Sylo
npm install
cp .env.example .env        # fill in DISCORD_TOKEN and DISCORD_CLIENT_ID
npm start
```

Or with Docker:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose logs -f sylo
```

The dashboard is then on `http://<host>:${WEB_PORT:-3000}` and the database
persists in `./data`.

For fast iteration set `DISCORD_DEV_GUILD_IDS` to a test server's id — commands
register to it instantly instead of taking up to ~1 hour globally. `npm run
register` re-syncs commands without a restart.

## Environment variables

Only `DISCORD_TOKEN` and `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID` are required.

| Variable                  | Default                         | Description |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------|
| `DISCORD_TOKEN`           | —                               | Bot token (**required**) |
| `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID`       | —                               | Application (client) id (**required**) |
| `DISCORD_DEV_GUILD_IDS`   | —                               | Register commands instantly to one or more servers (comma/space-separated) instead of globally. Old name `DISCORD_GUILD_ID` still works (warns). |
| `DISCORD_SHARD_COUNT`     | `auto`                          | Internal gateway shards for this one process. `auto` follows Discord's recommendation and stays at 1 below ~2,500 servers; pin an integer to override. Multi-process sharding is not supported. |
| `WEB_PORT`                | `3000`                          | Dashboard HTTP port |
| `DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET`   | —                               | Set to require "Log in with Discord" on the dashboard |
| `SESSION_SECRET`          | random                          | Signs the session cookie; pin it so logins survive restarts |
| `OWNER_IDS`               | —                               | Your Discord user id(s), comma/space-separated. Gates `/health` to just these accounts when `DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET` is set — everyone else is blocked, not just non-admins |
| `DEV_LOG_CHANNEL_ID`      | —                               | A channel id Sylo posts its own errors to — a "dev-log", separate from any per-guild logging/modlog channel. Optional; without it there's no proactive notification |
| `DASHBOARD_URL`           | derived                         | Public dashboard URL; needed behind a reverse proxy and for verification-captcha / ban-appeal links |
| `TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY`      | —                               | Cloudflare Turnstile site key — enables the Verification captcha mode |
| `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY`    | —                               | Cloudflare Turnstile secret key (pair with the site key) |
| `ITAD_API_KEY`            | —                               | IsThereAnyDeal key — adds non-Epic stores to the Free games module |
| `INTENT_GUILD_MEMBERS`    | `true`                          | Request the Server Members privileged intent |
| `INTENT_MESSAGE_CONTENT`  | `true`                          | Request the Message Content privileged intent |
| `GAMETOOLS_API_BASE`      | `https://api.gametools.network` | Stats API base URL |
| `STATS_CACHE_TTL_MINUTES` | `5`                             | How long stats lookups are cached |
| `DATABASE_PATH`           | `./data/sylo.db`                | SQLite file path |
| `DATABASE_URL`            | —                               | Optional: a `postgres://` URL to use Postgres instead of SQLite. Hosted-scale deployments only — see [docs/postgres.md](https://github.com/Ferdinand99/Sylo/blob/main/docs/postgres.md). Unset (default) means nothing about the setup below changes. |
| `BACKUP_INTERVAL_HOURS`   | `24`                            | Scheduled DB snapshot interval; `0` disables it (pre-migration + manual still run) |
| `BACKUP_RETENTION`        | `14`                            | How many DB snapshots to keep in `<data>/backups` |
| `BACKUP_DIR`              | `<db dir>/backups`              | Where DB snapshots are written |
| `LOG_LEVEL`               | `info`                          | `debug` / `info` / `warn` / `error` |
| `LOG_FORMAT`              | `text`                          | `text` or `json` (`LOG_JSON=1` = json) |
| `NODE_ENV`                | `development`                   | Set to `production` in deployment |

### Privileged intents

Both privileged intents default **on**. Several modules need them:

| Intent | Env var | Modules that need it |
|---|---|---|
| Server Members | `INTENT_GUILD_MEMBERS` | logging, roles, verification, welcome, leveling, server-stats, invite-tracker |
| Message Content | `INTENT_MESSAGE_CONTENT` | logging, autoresponder, counting, automod, starboard |

Enable them on the Discord Developer Portal (**Bot → Privileged Gateway
Intents**). If you don't want those modules, set the env var to `false` and Sylo
starts without requesting that intent. A verified bot (100+ servers) needs
Discord's approval for Message Content.

---

## Discord application setup

1. <https://discord.com/developers/applications> → **New Application**.
2. **Bot** tab → **Reset Token** → copy into `DISCORD_TOKEN`. Enable the
   privileged intents you need (see above).
3. **General Information** → copy **Application ID** into `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID`.
4. **OAuth2 → URL Generator** → scopes `bot` + `applications.commands`. Bot
   permissions:
   - **Send Messages**, **Embed Links** — always
   - **Attach Files** — welcome images, rank cards, leaderboard cards
   - **Kick Members**, **Ban Members**, **Moderate Members**, **Manage Messages** — moderation
   - **Manage Channels** — `/lock`, `/lockdown`, `/slowmode`, temporary voice
   - **Manage Roles** — reaction roles, autoroles, verification, leveling rewards, birthday role
   - **Move Members** — temporary voice channels
   - **Manage Server** — invite tracker (reads the invite list) and the automod
     push to native Discord AutoMod (creates/edits `Sylo:`-named rules)

   Open the generated URL to invite the bot. Tickets (modmail) need no extra
   permission — just leave the bot able to receive DMs.
5. Drag **Sylo's role above the roles it should manage** in *Server Settings →
   Roles*. The bot can never kick/ban/timeout someone whose highest role sits
   above its own, or edit a role above its own.

## Dashboard authentication

By default the dashboard runs **open** (no login) — only safe on `localhost` or a
trusted LAN. Even in open mode a same-origin check blocks cross-site form posts.

To require a login:

1. Developer Portal → your app → **OAuth2** → copy the **Client Secret** into
   `DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET`.
2. Same page → **Redirects** → add `<DASHBOARD_URL>/auth/discord/callback`
   (e.g. `http://192.168.1.10:3000/auth/discord/callback`, or the public HTTPS
   URL behind a proxy).
3. Set a long random `SESSION_SECRET`.
4. Set `OWNER_IDS` to your own Discord user id — without it, `/health` (status,
   error log, database backup/restore) is reachable by no one, not even you.

With `DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET` set, every page except the `/health` JSON and the
`/metrics` scrape endpoint requires "Log in with Discord". Per-server pages
require **Manage Server** (or Administrator / owner) in that server, or one of the
**bot-master roles** set on that server's *Settings* page.

`/health` (JSON) and `/metrics` stay unauthenticated so a monitor or Prometheus
can reach them — keep them on your LAN, or restrict them at the reverse proxy if
the dashboard is public.

Point Prometheus at `<host>:<WEB_PORT>/metrics` and import
`docs/grafana-dashboard.json` for a ready-made overview (gateway health, guild
count, HTTP and command rates, DB size, module adoption).

### Off-site backups

Every local snapshot can also be shipped, gzipped, to a remote target — set any
of `BACKUP_WEBDAV_URL` (+ `BACKUP_WEBDAV_USER` / `BACKUP_WEBDAV_PASS`, e.g. a
Nextcloud folder) or `BACKUP_WEBHOOK_URL` (a Discord webhook; attachments over
~8 MiB are skipped). Uploads are best-effort and logged; they never hold up the
local backup. The Health page shows which targets are active.

---

## Behind a reverse proxy

Set `DASHBOARD_URL` to the public URL and proxy to `127.0.0.1:${WEB_PORT}`. Sylo
then trusts one proxy hop (`X-Forwarded-*`), which it needs for correct client
IPs (rate limiting) and OAuth redirects. Make sure the OAuth **redirect** in the
Developer Portal matches `<DASHBOARD_URL>/auth/discord/callback`.

**Caddy**

```caddyfile
sylo.example.com {
    reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:3000
}
```

**nginx**

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name sylo.example.com;
    # ssl_certificate ... ;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000;
        proxy_set_header Host              $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For   $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

```ini
DASHBOARD_URL=https://sylo.example.com
```

---

## Docker

The bundled `docker-compose.yml` builds from source, mounts `./data`, and sets a
restart policy (needed so a dashboard **Restore** can restart the container).

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d --build
```

### Prebuilt images

CI publishes multi-arch (`linux/amd64` + `linux/arm64`) images to two registries:

| Tag | Registry | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `iwgamin/sylo:latest`, `:X.Y.Z`, `:X.Y` | [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/iwgamin/sylo) · [GHCR](https://github.com/Ferdinand99/Sylo/pkgs/container/sylo) | Stable releases. What the Unraid template pulls. |
| `ghcr.io/ferdinand99/sylo:main`, `:sha-<short>` | GHCR only | Rolling build of `main` — every push. |

```bash
docker run -d --name sylo -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env \
  -v "$PWD/data:/app/data" --restart unless-stopped iwgamin/sylo:latest
```

If `better-sqlite3` ever fails to build on Alpine for your platform, change the
two `FROM node:22-alpine` lines in the `Dockerfile` to `node:22-slim`.

---

## Unraid

Sylo is in the Unraid **Community Applications** store — search "Sylo". The
template's source of truth is
[Ferdinand99/unraid-templates](https://github.com/Ferdinand99/unraid-templates)
(`templates/sylo.xml`) — edits there propagate to existing installs
automatically via `<TemplateURL>`, so no re-submission is needed for config
changes. If Community Applications hasn't picked up that repository yet, add
`https://github.com/Ferdinand99/unraid-templates` under Docker → Template
repositories to install the current template directly.

Manual container setup (Docker tab → Add Container):

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Repository | `docker.io/iwgamin/sylo:latest` |
| Network | `bridge` |
| Port | Container `3000` → Host `3000` |
| Path | Container `/app/data` → a real local path (see the caveat below) |
| Variable | `DISCORD_TOKEN`, `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID`, `NODE_ENV=production` |

The image starts as root only long enough to fix ownership of the data
directory, then runs as an unprivileged user (`sylo`, uid 100). A fresh
root-owned folder works out of the box. If you still see `SQLITE_CANTOPEN`, run
once: `chown -R 100:101 <data path>`.

---

## SQLite on a network mount

**Put the data directory on a real local disk**, not a network share.
`better-sqlite3` uses WAL mode, which needs working file locks and `mmap`. SMB,
NFS, Unraid's `/mnt/user` (shfs / FUSE) and some Docker-Desktop bind mounts don't
provide them reliably, and you get `SQLITE_IOERR`, `database is locked`, or
silent corruption.

- **Unraid:** use a cache-pool path such as `/mnt/cache/appdata/sylo`, or a
  disk-share path like `/mnt/disk1/appdata/sylo` — not `/mnt/user/...`.
- **NAS / remote:** run Sylo on the box that owns the disk, or use a local
  volume.

---

## Backups

All state is one SQLite file (`data/sylo.db` + `-wal` / `-shm` sidecars) —
this section assumes that default setup. Running with `DATABASE_URL` set
instead? See [docs/postgres.md](https://github.com/Ferdinand99/Sylo/blob/main/docs/postgres.md#backups-and-restore-on-postgres)
— the same buttons and flow, `pg_dump`/`pg_restore` under the hood.

**Automatic snapshots** are written to `data/backups/`: one before any schema
migration, one shortly after start, and one every `BACKUP_INTERVAL_HOURS`
(default 24), keeping the newest `BACKUP_RETENTION` (default 14). Set
`BACKUP_INTERVAL_HOURS=0` to keep only the pre-migration and manual ones.

**From the dashboard Health page** you can create a snapshot now, import a `.db`
from another machine (validated: SQLite header, `integrity_check`, schema no
newer than this build), download any snapshot, and **Restore** — which takes a
`prerestore` snapshot, swaps the file, and exits so the container restarts on the
restored data (needs a restart policy).

**Manual restore:** stop the container, copy a snapshot over `data/sylo.db`
(delete the `-wal` / `-shm` sidecars first), start again. Migrations only ever
move the schema forward; Sylo runs a `quick_check` on boot and logs corruption.

Per-server module config can also be exported as JSON from **General → Backup**.

---

## Upgrades and rollback

**Upgrade (prebuilt image):**

```bash
docker compose pull        # or: docker pull iwgamin/sylo:latest
docker compose up -d
```

**Upgrade (from source):**

```bash
git pull
npm install
# restart the process / container
```

On start, Sylo applies any new schema migrations inside a transaction, taking a
`sylo-premigrate-vN-*.db` snapshot first.

**Rollback:** pull the previous image tag (`iwgamin/sylo:3.4.1`), or `git
checkout` the previous tag, then restore the matching `sylo-premigrate-*` (or a
dated) snapshot from `data/backups/` over `data/sylo.db`. A newer database can't
be opened by an older build — the schema check refuses it — so always roll the
database back together with the code.

---

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause / fix |
|---|---|
| `Used disallowed intents` on start | A privileged intent is requested but not enabled in the Developer Portal. Enable it, or set `INTENT_GUILD_MEMBERS=false` / `INTENT_MESSAGE_CONTENT=false`. |
| Slash commands don't appear | Global registration takes up to ~1 hour. Set `DISCORD_DEV_GUILD_IDS` for instant per-server registration, or wait. `npm run register` re-syncs. |
| "Log in with Discord" loops / `redirect_uri` mismatch | The Developer Portal **Redirect** must exactly equal `<DASHBOARD_URL>/auth/discord/callback`, scheme and port included. |
| `SQLITE_CANTOPEN` | The data directory isn't writable by uid 100. `chown -R 100:101 <data path>`. |
| `SQLITE_IOERR`, `database is locked`, corruption | The database is on a network share. Move it to a local disk — see [SQLite on a network mount](#sqlite-on-a-network-mount). |
| `better-sqlite3` fails to build | Switch the `Dockerfile` base images to `node:22-slim`, or install `python3 make g++` for a from-source build. |
| Moderation says it can't act on a member | Sylo's highest role must sit above the target's, and it needs the relevant permission (Ban/Kick/Moderate Members). |
| Welcome image / rank card missing | The bot lacks **Attach Files** in that channel, or `@napi-rs/canvas` didn't load on this platform (a warning is logged; the text message still sends). |
| Dashboard shows "open mode — no auth" | `DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET` isn't set. That's expected for LAN use; set it to require a login. |
